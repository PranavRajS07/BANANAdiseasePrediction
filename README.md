# BANANAdiseasePrediction
India is the leading country in Banana plantation and production in the World standings. During this plantation, the Banana plant gets affected by various different sorts of diseases which inhibits its growth and deprives the quality of the Banana fruit.
In this project, we propose a CNN based machine learning solution for the identification of diseases which are caused in Banana plants which facilitates farmers, especially newbie farmers in finding the type of the disease effectively, for further treatment. A collection of images of Banana plantation disease is given as input. 
With the help of CNN layers, we analyse the images and predict the exact disease which affected the plant as an output. This will be explained further in detail.
